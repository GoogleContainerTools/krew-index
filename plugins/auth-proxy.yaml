  shortDescription: Authentication proxy to a pod or service
  description: |
    This is a kubectl plugin to forward a local port to a pod or service via the authentication proxy.
    It gets a token from the current credential plugin (e.g. aws-iam-authenticator or kubelogin).
    Then it appends the authorization header to HTTP requests, like `authorization: Bearer token`.
    All traffic is routed by the authentication proxy and port forwarder as follows:
      [browser] -> [authentication proxy] -> [port forwarder] -> [pod]

  caveats: |
    You need to configure authentication in the kubeconfig.
    See https://github.com/int128/kauthproxy for more.
