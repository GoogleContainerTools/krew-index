  homepage: https://github.com/knight42/kubectl-blame
  caveats: |
      The plugin is only compatible with kubernetes versions 1.18 and above.
 
      As long as the field '.metadata.managedFields' of the given resource is 
      set properly, this command is able to display the manager of each field.
