  shortDescription: NetworkPolicy analysis tool suite
  homepage: https://github.com/mattfenwick/kubectl-cyclonus
  description: |
    This plugin provides a suite of tools for working with network policies, including:
    - linting to detect common problems
    - target- and pod-based resolution of policies, to understand how policies work in practice
      and override each other
    - simulation of traffic allow/deny based on application of policies to source and destination
      pod and namespace labels and IP addresses
