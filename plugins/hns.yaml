  shortDescription: Manage hierarchical namespaces (part of HNC)
  description: |
    Manipulates hierarchical namespaces provided by the Hierarchical Namespace
    Controller (HNC).

    HNC allows you to arrange your namespaces into hierarchies, which enables
    two key benefits:
    * Users without cluster-level permissions to create namespaces can create
      restricted "subnamespaces" instead.
    * Owners of parent namespaces can create policies that are enforced on
      all descendant namespaces.

    HNC is controlled via regular Kubernetes objects, but this plugin makes it
    easy to create subnamespaces, arrange regular (full) namespaces into
    hierarchies, and configure HNC to propagate different kinds of objects.
  version: v0.6.0
  caveats: |
    This plugin requires HNC v0.6.x on your cluster. Get it at

      https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/releases/tag/hnc-v0.6.0

    or via:

      kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/releases/download/hnc-v0.6.0/hnc-manager.yaml

    This version of the plugin uses the HNC v1alpha2 API, and is not compatible
    with HNC v0.5.x, which only provides v1alpha1. If you need the plugin for
    HNC v0.5.x, please follow the installation directions from the release page
    for your version.

    Watch out for the following common misconceptions when using HNC:

    * Not all child namespaces are subnamespaces!
    * Only RBAC Roles and RoleBindings are propagated by default, but you can configure more

    The user guide contains much more information.
