  shortDescription: Log in to the OpenID Connect provider
  description: |
    This is a kubectl plugin for Kubernetes OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.

    ## Credential plugin mode
    kubectl executes oidc-login before calling the Kubernetes APIs.
    oidc-login automatically opens the browser and you can log in to the provider.
    After authentication, kubectl gets the token from oidc-login and you can access the cluster.
    See https://github.com/int128/kubelogin#credential-plugin-mode for more.

    ## Standalone mode
    Run `kubectl oidc-login`.
    It automatically opens the browser and you can log in to the provider.
    After authentication, it writes the token to the kubeconfig and you can access the cluster.
    See https://github.com/int128/kubelogin#standalone-mode for more.

  caveats: |
    You need to setup the OIDC provider, Kubernetes API server, role binding and kubeconfig.
    See https://github.com/int128/kubelogin for more.
