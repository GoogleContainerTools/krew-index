  shortDescription: Extends kubectl with some OpenStack commands
  caveats: |
    This plugin only works with Kubernetes clusters running on OpenStack.
    Also the environment has to be set up as described here:
    https://github.com/sbueringer/kubectl-openstack-plugin
  description: |
    This plugin adds a few additional commands to kubectl to query for
    OpenStack objects. This of course only makes sense if the Kubernetes
    cluster is running on Openstack and the user has access to OpenStack
    credentials. Some of these commands are:

    # Shows PersistentVolumes joined with the corresponding OpenStack disks
    kubectl openstack volumes

    # Shows Services joined with the corresponding OpenStack LBaaS objects
    kubectl openstack lb

    # Show Nodes joined with the corresponding OpenStack servers
    kubectl openstack server
