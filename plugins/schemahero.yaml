    SchemaHero is an open-source database schema migration tool that converts 
    a schema definition into migration scripts that can be applied in any 
    environment. Written as both a CLI utility and a Kubernetes Operator, 
    SchemaHero eliminates the task of creating and managing sequenced 
    migration scripts that are compatible with all environments that an 
    application is running in.
