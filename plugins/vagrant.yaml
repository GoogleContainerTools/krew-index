  shortDescription: create a multi-node kubernetes cluster locally with vagrant
  version: v0.1.0
  description: |
    `kube-vagrant` is a kubectl plugin to create a multi-node kubernetes
    cluster locally with vagrant, so you can quickly set up a dev cluster
    with one command line.

    `kube-vagrant` is similar to [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
    which also provides command line interface to create kubernetes cluster
    but only on a cloud environment (aws, gce or openstack). `kube-vagrant`
    and `kops` not in conflict but complementary.

    Usage:
      # create a cluster with default settings (3 nodes with 2GB mem each)
      $ kubectl vagrant up

      # when cluster is created, config yaml will be saved to .kube/config
      $ kubectl --kubeconfig=.kube/config cluster-info

  caveats: |
    This plugin requires vagrant and virtualbox
