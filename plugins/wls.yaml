    kubectl interactive plugin to access a shell on windows or Linux nodes.
    For Linux nodes: It works by creating a pod (with a privileged container) in the node you specified and using nsenter for getting a shell into your Kubernetes nodes.
    For windows nodes: It creates a pod in any available Linux node, and it uses ssh to access windows nodes that have ssh enabled.
